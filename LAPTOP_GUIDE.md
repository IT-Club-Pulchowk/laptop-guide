- **Duration Used**: about 1.5 years
- **Price Range**:  Bought at 178k (Nrs.) exact
- **Specs (Initial)**
  - CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H @ 2.59GHz base clock (6 cores)

  - Memory - 16GB DDR4, 2667 MHz

- **Review**
  - Pros - Godly gaming laptop, for programming, rendering, video editing and basically runs everything that's not RTX based (chrome can have it's fill and you'll still have memory to spare )
  - Cons - Expensive, battery life 2hrs (extended upto 3hrs), and I might sound like a broken record but EXPENSIVE. The colour accuracy isn't that great so might want a separate monitor
