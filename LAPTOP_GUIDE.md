### Laptop Reviews and Recommendations :

1. ***Laptop:*** **Acer Predator Helios 300(2019) [17"]**
- **Duration Used**: about 1.5 years

  - Storage - 1 TB HDD + 256gig SSD
- **Review**
  - Pros - Godly gaming laptop, for programming, rendering, video editing and basically runs everything that's not RTX based (chrome can have it's fill and you'll still have memory to spare )
  - Cons - Expensive, battery life 2hrs (extended upto 3hrs), and I might sound like a broken record but EXPENSIVE. The colour accuracy isn't that great so might want a separate monitor

2. ***Laptop:*** **Dell Inspiron 3543 (15")**

  - Storage - 1 TB HDD
- **Review**
  - Pros - Highly upgrade-able with dual RAM slots, Numeric keypad makes life easier, easy access to ram and HDD and replaceable battery module others too general.
  - Cons - No keyboard back-light. Battery-life (expectedly) has become non existent. Single channel memory with a very slow hard drive results in horrendous boot time after such a long use. 
     -All in all its a pretty balanced(&powerful) laptop for its time. Capable enough to game competitive fps with ~50 fps consistent with few frame drops) and even run light blender renders.
- **Recommendation**
