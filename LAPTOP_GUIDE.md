### Laptop Reviews and Recommendations :

1. ***Laptop:*** **Acer Predator Helios 300(2019) [17"]**
- **Duration Used**: about 1.5 years

  - Storage - 1 TB HDD + 256gig SSD
- **Review**
  - Pros - Godly gaming laptop, for programming, rendering, video editing and basically runs everything that's not RTX based (chrome can have it's fill and you'll still have memory to spare )
  - Cons - Expensive, battery life 2hrs (extended upto 3hrs), and I might sound like a broken record but EXPENSIVE. The colour accuracy isn't that great so might want a separate monitor

2. ***Laptop:*** **Dell Inspiron 3543 (15")**

  - Storage - 1 TB HDD
- **Review**
  - Pros - Highly upgrade-able with dual RAM slots, Numeric keypad makes life easier, easy access to ram and HDD and replaceable battery module others too general.
  - Cons - No keyboard back-light. Battery-life (expectedly) has become non existent. Single channel memory with a very slow hard drive results in horrendous boot time after such a long use. 
     -All in all its a pretty balanced(&powerful) laptop for its time. Capable enough to game competitive fps with ~50 fps consistent with few frame drops) and even run light blender renders.
- **Recommendation**

Storage - 1 TB HDD (Bought later) + 256gig SSD
- **Review**
 -Pros: An absolute BEAST  of a gaming laptop, CAN DO ABSOLUTELY everything, rendering, gaming, coding, movies, animation. The Works. BIG bang for the buck. Can handle easily multiple monitors for Editing and other stuff
 -Cons: Very Expensive, battery life a max of 2hrs. ..and with this particular model, a HEATING PROBLEM. So ye, basically it's a case of it being overclocked by default, so u need to undervolt it to get it working decently

7. ***Laptop*** **Apple Macbook Air(early 2015)**
- **Duration Used:** about 5 years
- **Price Range:** Bought at ~  Nrs.126k
- **Specs (Initial):** CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) 1.6 Ghz Dual-core Intel core i5
GPU -  Intel HD 6000
Memory - 8 GB DDR4 
Storage - 256 GB Flash(basically Apple's early way of defining an SSD-esque storage)

- **Review**
 -Pros: A true notebook; extremely lightweight and effortlessly sleek.
Extremely longlasting, have been going at this baby for the past 5 years, shows little to no signs of wear and tear. Capable of any handling sort of load you throw at it. Huge battery life
 -Cons: BAD for deep learning*. Lack of any kind of GPU support on those last gen lineup of Macs. Proved to be a logistical difficulty when lab teachers in 1st year implored you to install pirated versions of Proteus. Can't natively install Windows in m1 lineups
- **Recommendation** 10/10 recommend the new M1 macbooks. For 899(student discount) you get performance beating ultrabooks in the $1500-1700 price range. Would have personally bought an m1 macbook if not for its inability to support tensorflow.

- **Duration Used:** 3 years

- **Review**
 -Pros: Business Designed Laptop, Good stereo speakers, Great support and reparability inside the country and also good customer service by their website too, Good keyboard. Great options of Ports.
 -Cons: Abysmal battery life 2 hours when brand new but now, Barely an hour in zorin OS and 40 mins max on windows, Keyboard's kinda loud to type in public/Library ( May vary ), No backlit Keyboard, weighs a bit high, No good for gaming and even weaker performance when not plugged in.
- **Recommendation** Although a great laptop for its time, better laptops are out there. Get an SSD if you do buy one.
