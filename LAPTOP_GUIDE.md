1. ***Laptop:*** **Acer Predator Helios 300(2019) [17"]**
- **Duration Used**: about 1.5 years

  - Memory - 16GB DDR4, 2667 MHz
  - Storage - 1 TB HDD + 256gig SSD
- **Review**
  - Pros - Godly gaming laptop, for programming, rendering, video editing and basically runs everything that's not RTX based (chrome can have it's fill and you'll still have memory to spare )
  - Cons - Expensive, battery life 2hrs (extended upto 3hrs), and I might sound like a broken record but EXPENSIVE. The colour accuracy isn't that great so might want a separate monitor

2. ***Laptop*** **Dell Inspiron 3543 (15")**
- **Duration Used**: about 5 years (is a hand-me-down been using personally for 1.5 yrs)
- **Price Range**: Bought at ~ 81k (Nrs.) (in china)
- **Specs (Initial/Current)**
  - CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5500U @ 2.4GHz base boosts to 2.92GHz (dual core 4 threads) 
  - GPU - Intel UHD Graphics 5500+ 2 GB Nvidia 840m
  - Memory - 8 GB DDR4, 1600Mhz
  - Storage - 1 TB HDD
- **Review**
  - Pros - Highly upgrade-able with dual RAM slots, Numeric keypad makes life easier, easy access to ram and HDD and replaceable battery module others too general.
  - Cons 
     - No keyboard back-light. Battery-life (expectedly) has become non existent. Single channel memory with a very slow hard drive results in horrendous boot time after such a long use. 
     -All in all its a pretty balanced(&powerful) laptop for its time. Capable enough to game competitive fps with ~50 fps consistent with few frame drops) and even run light blender renders.
- **Recommendation**
  - Add SSD
