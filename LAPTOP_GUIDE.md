  - Storage - 1 TB HDD + 256gig SSD
- **Review**

  - Cons - Expensive, battery life 2hrs (extended upto 3hrs), and I might sound like a broken record but EXPENSIVE. The colour accuracy isn't that great so might want a separate monitor

2. ***Laptop:*** **Dell Inspiron 3543 (15")**

- **Review**
  - Pros - Highly upgrade-able with dual RAM slots, Numeric keypad makes life easier, easy access to ram and HDD and replaceable battery module others too general.
  - Cons - No keyboard back-light. Battery-life (expectedly) has become non existent. Single channel memory with a very slow hard drive results in horrendous boot time after such a long use. 
     -All in all its a pretty balanced(&powerful) laptop for its time. Capable enough to game competitive fps with ~50 fps consistent with few frame drops) and even run light blender renders.
- **Recommendation**

- **Review**
 -Pros: An absolute BEAST  of a gaming laptop, CAN DO ABSOLUTELY everything, rendering, gaming, coding, movies, animation. The Works. BIG bang for the buck. Can handle easily multiple monitors for Editing and other stuff
 -Cons: Very Expensive, battery life a max of 2hrs. ..and with this particular model, a HEATING PROBLEM. So ye, basically it's a case of it being overclocked by default, so u need to undervolt it to get it working decently

7. ***Laptop*** **Apple Macbook Air(early 2015)**
- **Duration Used:** about 5 years
- **Price Range:** Bought at ~  Nrs.126k
- **Specs (Initial):** CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) 1.6 Ghz Dual-core Intel core i5
GPU -  Intel HD 6000
Memory - 8 GB DDR4 
Storage - 256 GB Flash(basically Apple's early way of defining an SSD-esque storage)

- **Review**
 -Pros: A true notebook; extremely lightweight and effortlessly sleek.
Extremely longlasting, have been going at this baby for the past 5 years, shows little to no signs of wear and tear. Capable of any handling sort of load you throw at it. Huge battery life
 -Cons: BAD for deep learning*. Lack of any kind of GPU support on those last gen lineup of Macs. Proved to be a logistical difficulty when lab teachers in 1st year implored you to install pirated versions of Proteus. Can't natively install Windows in m1 lineups
- **Recommendation** 10/10 recommend the new M1 macbooks. For 899(student discount) you get performance beating ultrabooks in the $1500-1700 price range. Would have personally bought an m1 macbook if not for its inability to support tensorflow.

- **Recommendation** Although a great laptop for its time, better laptops are out there. Get an SSD if you do buy one.

- **Review**
 -Pros: Being dell , has an excellent support for linux (the NVIDIA GPU may sometimes give you a hassle). **Lots of ports** (in today's standards) : 3 USB type-A, 1 USB type-C, 1 optical drive(Who uses ot these days, but nice to have), ethernet, full sized HDMI, earphone-mic mixture jack, barrel jack, SD card reader. Numeric keyboard (makes a difference) and a fingerprint sensor. Expandable RAM, SSD. Wonderful build quality (dropped twice, littel scratch and a little broken chassis but nothing terrible and unbearable). Others are kinda general.
 -Cons: Sometimes overheats (when heating the fan runs just over the WASD keys spreading more heat there. Kinda okay for gaming (Don't expect anything great). A little bit on the heavier side (when compared with other notebooks)

10.  ***Laptop*** **Dell Inspiron 5570**
- **Duration Used:** 3 years
- **Price Range:** 70k Nrs
- **Specs (Initial):**

   - Storage - 1TB HDD +  256GB PCIe NVMe SSD (upgraded later)
- **Review**
 -Pros: Pretty good laptop for programming purposes, if you wanna stuffs like web development, but definitely not for heavy stuffs like Game dev.Good keyboard. A lot of ports: 2 USB 3.0 ports + 1 USB 2.0 port, USB type C port (no Thunderbolt, but I haven't used it either), HDMI, Ethernet, headphone jack.Also has a DVD driver
 -Cons: Not that good for heavy gaming. Heavy games run great in medium settings, but expect overheating. (Happened last time I played Batman Arkham Knight)Need to replace battery after 2 years. Unlike Vostro, Latitude and older Inspiron models, doesn't have a removable battery, you need to actually open the back cover to replace it.
- **Recommendation** Great student laptop, great if you just want to do minimal stuffs like surfing the internet, watching movies and word processing. Not that good for heavy tasks.
