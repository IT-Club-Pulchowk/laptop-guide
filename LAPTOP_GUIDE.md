### Laptop Reviews and Recommendations :

- **Duration Used**: about 1.5 years
- **Price Range**:  Bought at 178k (Nrs.) exact

  - Storage - 1 TB HDD + 256gig SSD
- **Review**
  - Pros - Godly gaming laptop, for programming, rendering, video editing and basically runs everything that's not RTX based (chrome can have it's fill and you'll still have memory to spare )
  - Cons - Expensive, battery life 2hrs (extended upto 3hrs), and I might sound like a broken record but EXPENSIVE. The colour accuracy isn't that great so might want a separate monitor

2. ***Laptop:*** **Dell Inspiron 3543 (15")**
- **Duration Used**: about 5 years (is a hand-me-down been using personally for 1.5 yrs)
- **Price Range**: Bought at ~ 81k (Nrs.) (in china)

- **Review**
  - Pros - Highly upgrade-able with dual RAM slots, Numeric keypad makes life easier, easy access to ram and HDD and replaceable battery module others too general.
  - Cons - No keyboard back-light. Battery-life (expectedly) has become non existent. Single channel memory with a very slow hard drive results in horrendous boot time after such a long use. 
     -All in all its a pretty balanced(&powerful) laptop for its time. Capable enough to game competitive fps with ~50 fps consistent with few frame drops) and even run light blender renders.
- **Recommendation**

    - Pros: An absolute BEAST  of a gaming laptop, CAN DO ABSOLUTELY everything, rendering, gaming, coding, movies, animation. The Works. BIG bang for the buck. Can handle easily multiple monitors for Editing and other stuff
    - Cons: Very Expensive, battery life a max of 2hrs. ..and with this particular model, a HEATING PROBLEM. So ye, basically it's a case of it being overclocked by default, so u need to undervolt it to get it working decently

7. ***Laptop*** **Apple Macbook Air(early 2015)**
- **Duration Used:** about 5 years
- **Price Range:** Bought at ~  Nrs.126k
- **Specs (Initial):** 
   - CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) 1.6 Ghz Dual-core Intel core i5
   - GPU -  Intel HD 6000
   - Memory - 8 GB DDR4 
   - Storage - 256 GB Flash(basically Apple's early way of defining an SSD-esque storage)

- **Review**
   - **Pros:** A true notebook; extremely lightweight and effortlessly sleek.
Extremely longlasting, have been going at this baby for the past 5 years, shows little to no signs of wear and tear. Capable of any handling sort of load you throw at it. Huge battery life
   - **Cons:** BAD for deep learning*. Lack of any kind of GPU support on those last gen lineup of Macs. Proved to be a logistical difficulty when lab teachers in 1st year implored you to install pirated versions of Proteus. Can't natively install Windows in m1 lineups
- **Recommendation** 10/10 recommend the new M1 macbooks. For 899(student discount) you get performance beating ultrabooks in the $1500-1700 price range. Would have personally bought an m1 macbook if not for its inability to support tensorflow.

- **Recommendation** Although a great laptop for its time, better laptops are out there. Get an SSD if you do buy one.

    - **Pros:** Attractive, lightweight  chassis
Decent performance for the build
Very good and bright display, I mean very good for 1080p, colors pop
Long battery life (10hrs movie play back after 1.5 years of initial purchase)
Crisp, powerful speakers for its size(fine tuned by Bang & Olufsen) 
Electronic physical  webcam kill switch
Genuine windows digitally licensed to your personal Microsoft account
Windows hello login through fingerprint scanner is always a win. (Doesn't have windows hello face tho)
Some people may take it as a con but is dead silent during basic web surfing and light tasks 
    - **Cons:**  Barrel port charging
Very minimal I/O ports, 2 regular sized USB and a single type C, No RJ-45 port, No HDMI port, has micro-sd card port instead of full sized sd card slot.
soldered ram, can't upgrade anything other than wifi-card down the line which is also a big hassle due to ultrabook nature. 
I don't game but probably won't be a good gaming experience
Noticeable coil whine occasionally
It has glossy finish and works as a mirror in outdoor settings

10. ***Laptop:*** **Lenovo IdeaPad 310**
- **Duration Used:** Since class 11 ( now in 2nd year )
- **Price Range:** Forgot exactly but should be around 70K
- **Specs (Initial):**
   - CPU - intel i5 7200U
   - GPU - intel uhd 630
   - Memory - 4gb onoard/soldered + one free sodimm slot (which then died for some reason :PepeHands~3: , stuck with 4 gigs)
   - Storage - 1TB HDD
- **Review**
    - Pros: Okay for light task like pdfs and webpages photoshop and stuff with 8gigs you could multitask rather well. 
    - Cons: It was okay until the ram slot died. Once got so hot that the rubber pads fell off. Know that you arent gonna do anything blender, video editing, gaming or even fucking Visual studio with 4 gigs. Even 8 gigs blenders viewport was bad and VS and jetbrains stuff lagged to death. it has served me decent on the nessasaries.

    - Pros: Being dell , has an excellent support for linux (the NVIDIA GPU may sometimes give you a hassle). **Lots of ports** (in today's standards) : 3 USB type-A, 1 USB type-C, 1 optical drive(Who uses ot these days, but nice to have), ethernet, full sized HDMI, earphone-mic mixture jack, barrel jack, SD card reader. Numeric keyboard (makes a difference) and a fingerprint sensor. Expandable RAM, SSD. Wonderful build quality (dropped twice, littel scratch and a little broken chassis but nothing terrible and unbearable). Others are kinda general.
    - Cons: Sometimes overheats (when heating the fan runs just over the WASD keys spreading more heat there. Kinda okay for gaming (Don't expect anything great). A little bit on the heavier side (when compared with other notebooks)

12.  ***Laptop*** **Dell Inspiron 5570**
- **Duration Used:** 3 years
- **Price Range:** 70k Nrs

- **Review**
    - Pros: Pretty good laptop for programming purposes, if you wanna stuffs like web development, but definitely not for heavy stuffs like Game dev.Good keyboard. A lot of ports: 2 USB 3.0 ports + 1 USB 2.0 port, USB type C port (no Thunderbolt, but I haven't used it either), HDMI, Ethernet, headphone jack.Also has a DVD driver
    - Cons: Not that good for heavy gaming. Heavy games run great in medium settings, but expect overheating. (Happened last time I played Batman Arkham Knight)Need to replace battery after 2 years. Unlike Vostro, Latitude and older Inspiron models, doesn't have a removable battery, you need to actually open the back cover to replace it.
    
- **Recommendation** Great student laptop, great if you just want to do minimal stuffs like surfing the internet, watching movies and word processing. Not that good for heavy tasks.

13.  ***Laptop*** ** HP Pavilion Power 2018**

- **Review**
    - Pros: Pretty good for the price range. Keyboard is decent enough for normal typing uses too. Good Cooling Systems
    - Cons:Lets not talk about the Elan Mousepad, just forget its presence. Brightness is not that good for outdoor conditions. HDD gets used to 100% alot
- **Recommendation** SSD upgrade is a must


14. ***Laptop:*** **Acer Aspire A315-51**
- **Duration Used:** 3.5 years +
- **Price Range:** Costs around 40k ig

  - CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6006U CPU @ 2.00GHz
  - GPU - Intel(R) HD Graphics 520
  - Memory - 4 GB DDR4 SDRAM
  - Storage - 1TB HDD initially (it stopped working 4 months ago so I now have just 120 GB M.2 SSD :< and nothing else)

- **Review**
  - Pros: There isn't any.
But, suprisingly its working fine  except for that HDD  damage. And works fine for enough chrome tabs.
Oh.. it has upgradable RAM and SSD slots so I could upgrade it.
Still gives 3-5 hr battery for normal use
15.6'' screen size and has Numeric keypad.
Its very cheap.

  - Cons: Pretty much every thing except its price
Heavy wt and size so not portable at all
Not for gaming or any heavy stuffs
When HDD  started to lag few months back using it I experienced hell. But with new SSD it runs pretty smooth.
ig its okay for its price.


15. ***Laptop:*** **Acer Predator Triton 500**
- **Duration Used:**  1 year+
- **Price Range:** Around 200k
- **Specs (Initial):** 
  - CPU -  I7 8th Gen
  - GPU - NVIDIA RTX 2060
  - Memory - 16GB DDR4 2667 MT/s RAM (Expandable upto 32 gb)
  - Storage - 512 NVME ssd
  - Dimension - 14.1 x 10.0 x 0.7 inches
- **Review**
    - Pros: 
      - Ultra portable yet powerful Laptop.  So pretty easy on back
and RTX with tensor cores you  would get reasonable Model Train performance, if you in to Deep Learning.
Does fine in almost all Machine Learning stuff.
      - Full Metal build, if you like such kind of thing.
      - You can do gaming, if you are into it,also if you are in windows, keyboard got some fancy tricks.
      - At last, overall great notebook experience.
    - Cons:
      - [Linux] Its so thin (less than inch) and no manually fan control so thermals peaks rather quickly,hence not really lap friendly while gaming and other heavy work.
In windows, its fine with max fan setting available.
      - Little costly, and if Part failure occurs you have to import things. I found this laptop rather uncommon in Nepal than its cousins (Helios 300s). 
- **Recommendation:**  Great laptop, and last for future both aesthetic  and capability wise. But got some trade-off.
